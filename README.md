The Best Weather app is in development for the purpose of making outdoors planning easier. 
With selected locations the user can find out which area has the best forecast and base trip 
decisions off of their own criteria. 
Data is taken directly from NOAA so as to aquire the most up ot date metrics.

As of 02/07/2020 this project contains the means to gather valuable data for decided locations
based off of gps coordinates and format them into a pandas dataframe. More work will need to be
done to make this more widely available through the implementation of a UI and more robust backend
framework.
